README

	A C++ program using threads and semaphores to simulate a 4-way traffic intersection
	

AUTHORS
	
	Christian Poynter and John Frederick


INSTALLATION AND EXECUTION
	
	To compile, execute "make" in the project directory. To run, execute "./run". Enter the total number of cars you wish to have simulated when prompted.
	

BUGS
	While the java version works, the c++ version does not. It runs correctly for a bit, but then starts behaving strangely and eventually hangs. We spent about 30 hours on the c++, but neither of us had any previous experience with pthreads, and we struggled with them.
